## This is the accompanying prompt guide to feed GPT. It assumes that you just opened a new converstaion with chatGPT. It serves to let AI understand what you are doing, what you need it to do, and how to give proper values to the functions. 

## Due to the token length limitation, I recemmend to develop the conversation gradually rather than throw it all together. It serves only as a rough guide and it's far from polished. Feel free to modify and experiment.

1. [Init STAGE]

    "Hi GPT, I want you to help me pose a Blender armature generated by the 'Human Generator' addon. I'll describe the pose I want, and you'll provide the appropriate values for a Python function that moves the bones. First, review the Python script below, which resets the armature to a standard A-pose and defines the move_bone() function. Let me know when you're ready to continue."

        [Paste GPT-POSER PYTHON SCRIPT]

2. [LEARN STAGE]

    "Great. Now I'll provide you with a list of bone names for the armature. You may only use these bones for the 'bone_name' argument in the move_bone() function. Remember that the armature is a tree-structured hierarchy with parent-child relationships between bones. The further down a child is, the further away it typically is from the main body.

    Also, note that the 'eyeball_lookat_master' bone should be 'grabbed' rather than 'rotated' to create 'look-at' effects. Familiarize yourself with the bone names and their hierarchy, and imagine all the possible poses a human can autonomically produce. When you're ready, say, 'I am ready to become a Choreographer.'"

3. [DO STAGE]

    "It's good to know you're ready. With the move_bone() function at your disposal, carefully listen to my pose prompt, and consider how a human would move and rotate their joints and bones within their anatomical limitations. Once you have a clear idea, provide the move_bone() commands and comments explaining the values. Here's the pose prompt:
